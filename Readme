A collection of scripts which automate routine stuff I do.

To install pre-requisites do:
bash install.sh

Info
mega.py:
pre-requisites:
1. Create and account on "https://forum.snahp.it/"
2. Create a file called "config.py" to hold your username and password.
	The contents of the file should be:
	"""
	username = "<your_username>"
	password = "<your_password>"
	"""

The main source for the links is "https://forum.snahp.it/"
It gets the top x posts under Movies/"720p / 1080p" and Tv/"720p / 1080p" along with names, views and the post URL.
